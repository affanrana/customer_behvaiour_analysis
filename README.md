Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Business Insights

Author: Affan Rana

Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence reporting. The objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights using industry-standard tools and practices commonly expected in data analyst roles.

The project integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI, and concludes with a professional report and presentation to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.

The dataset contains structured transactional and customer-related data used to analyze patterns, trends, and performance metrics.

Key characteristics:

Tabular format

Includes categorical and numerical variables

Suitable for descriptive analysis, aggregation, and visualization

(The dataset is loaded and processed using Python for analysis and SQL for querying.)

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (Data modeling and dashboarding)

Gamma (Presentation creation)

Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)
