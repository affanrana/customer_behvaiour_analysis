# Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Business Insights

Author: Affan Rana

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights using tools and techniques commonly expected in data analyst roles.

The project integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI, and concludes with a professional report and presentation to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of structured transactional and customer-related data used for analytical and reporting purposes.

Key characteristics:
- Tabular data format
- Combination of categorical and numerical variables
- Suitable for descriptive, diagnostic, and trend analysis

The dataset is loaded and processed in Python and queried using SQL databases.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- Power BI (Dashboarding and data modeling)
- Gamma (Presentation creation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
   - Load dataset into Python using Pandas
   - Inspect data structure and data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summary statistics and distributions
   - Identification of trends and patterns
   - Detection of missing values and outliers

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
   - Handle missing and inconsistent values
   - Correct data types and formats
   - Prepare data for SQL and BI analysis

4. SQL Analysis
   - Load cleaned data into relational databases
   - Execute SQL queries for aggregations, filtering, and KPIs
   - Perform business-focused data analysis

5. Business Intelligence Dashboard
   - Connect Power BI to SQL database
   - Build interactive dashboards and visuals
   - Highlight key metrics and trends

6. Reporting & Presentation
   - Create a structured analytical report
   - Design a professional presentation using Gamma
   - Communicate insights clearly to stakeholders

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for performance tracking
- Interactive filters and slicers
- Trend analysis using charts and tables
- Clear and business-focused visualizations

## Results & Insights
- Identified meaningful patterns and trends in the data
- Generated actionable business insights
- Delivered analysis in both technical and non-technical formats
- Demonstrated an end-to-end analytics workflow

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Perform EDA
   - Export data for SQL analysis

4. Execute SQL scripts in PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server.

5. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.
